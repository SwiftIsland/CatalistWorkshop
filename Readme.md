# This is an archived repo from our 2019 conference
# Catalyst Workshop: Nerau

This is the fully implemented version of Nerau for the SwiftIsland Catalyst Workshop.

It has very descriptive and small Commits so that you can easily pick a specific feature which you'd like to implement and understand the required changes based on the Commit.

Most commits also contain additional information about the change in the Commit message.

# Notes
- The non-catalyzed version of Nerau (the one without Catalyst support), that you will receive in the workhop, might have some small differences compared to this version in order to make your life easier.
- Don't jump back to older revisions. They might not compile due to some git revision rewriting

# About Nerau

Nerau will, at some point in the future, be a tool for patients that suffered cerebral bleeding. Victims oftentimes partially loose vision in the left or right side of the brain. Currently there exists several closed source, commercial solutions that help as a treatment by training the affected brain area via a simple game of location letters on a 2D field. Nerau will be an open source solution that implements such trainings free of charge. It will also contain additional functions for understanding the progress over time.

This, current, version is just a much simpler proof of concept. Mostly to have something to apply Catalyst on.
